# Week 3 Lab (Due: )
## Author: Rohan Singh  

In this weeks lab, we will be looking at File I/O in C. After completing this week's lab exercise you will learn how to read contents from a file in C and how to write in a file in C. 

## Files
Here is a description of the files in this week's lab:  
  - **readfile.c**: This file contains the source code on how to read a file using C.           
  - **writefile.c**: This file contains the source code on how to write something inside a file using C.      

## Writing and Compiling code in C
Here is a brief description on how to write/compile/run the code for your lab: 
  - **Connecting to the EECSLab server:** Instructions for this are on Canvas and will be demonstrated in class. For this lab you may run the code locally, but in future labs you may want to connect to the EECSLab server.    
  - **Opening VIM:** You should write your code using VIM, this is how you would use it-
    > vim filename.extenstion  
  - **Editing the file:** Once you open the file using vim, to enter the edit mode in VIM, you will have to do the following-  
    > :set paste <enter/return>  
    > i <enter/return>    
  - **Leaving the file:** Once you have edited the file, you can exit vim using-  
    > <esc>  
    > :wq  
  - **Compiling the code:** After writing your code you can compile your C code using the following command-  
    > cc filename.c  
  - **Running the compiled code:** To run the code you just comiled in C, you should-  
    > ./a.out  

If you are stuck on any of these steps, please check out the contact section to reach out to me.  

## Instructions for this weeks lab
Here are the file specific intructions as well as the submission instructions.  

**flowstatements.c:**  
  - You will be provided with a flow statement example of getting the sum of 'n' integers using for, while and do-while loops.      
  - Based on the example given above, you must design a C program that will calculate 'n!' (n factorial) using for and while loops.    
  - You will have to print out the results from the operation as output.    
  
**circulararray.c:**
  - You will be provided with the full code of a circular array in C, you will see throughout this course that this particular Data Structure is very important in different places in Operating Systems.  
  - Try to explain what is happening in the code by writing down comments. Your previous knowledge of circular arrays will come in handy over here.   
  - Try to come up with a real-life example where you would use circular arrays and use the methods from the circular array inside the main method of this file.  

**Submission:**  
You must attach a screenshot of you code and results of both programs in a pdf. In the same pdf you must also briefly describe the example/application that you chose for the circular array. You should submit this pdf on Canvas.
