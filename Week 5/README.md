# Week 5 
## Author: Rohan Singh  

Hello there!  
In this weeks lab we will talk about Structs in C. Structs are a way to group several related variables into one place. Each variable in the structure is known as a member of the struct. Unlike Arrays, Structs can hold several different data types.  

The easiest comparison to Java is that a Struct is an object that has only data points and no methods.  

Unlike Structs in C++, Structs in C don't have methods.  

## Writing and Compiling code in C
Here is a brief description on how to write/compile/run the code for your lab: 
  - **Connecting to the EECSLab server:** Instructions for this are on Canvas and will be demonstrated in class. For this lab you may run the code locally, but in future labs you may want to connect to the EECSLab server.    
  - **Opening VIM:** You should write your code using VIM, this is how you would use it-
    > vim filename.extenstion  
  - **Editing the file:** Once you open the file using vim, to enter the edit mode in VIM, you will have to do the following-  
    > :set paste <enter/return>  
    > i <enter/return>    
  - **Leaving the file:** Once you have edited the file, you can exit vim using-  
    > <esc>  
    > :wq  
  - **Compiling the code:** After writing your code you can compile your C code using the following command-  
    > cc filename.c  
  - **Running the compiled code:** To run the code you just comiled in C, you should-  
    > ./a.out

## Files
This weeks lab modules will demonstrate how to work with pointers in C.  
**Note:** You should look at them in the order in which they are listed here (Not the order in which they are in the directory).  

Files:
  - **employee.c**: This program is an introduction to structs, how to declare them, use them and dereference them.  
  - **linked_list.c:** This program contains code for a LinkedList using Structs.    
  - **queue.c:** This program contains code for a FIFO queue using Structs.
