# Compiler
## Author: Rohan Singh
This directory contains the source for the Compiler that we made on the CSDS 338 Lab on (2/15/23). This Compiler isn't designed to be very efficient, but is rather a simple compiler project to demonstrate how compiler design works. 

This compiler is for a language that follows the BASIC syntax https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC
