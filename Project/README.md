# Project 1 for CSDS 338

Project Idea for CSDS 338!!!

You could use this model to understand how operating systems allocate resources based on their pid, so that you could optimize them for resource sharing.  

To train it, you could use some data from various snapshots from top or proc/pid/maps and read it from a text file.
