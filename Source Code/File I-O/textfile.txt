Hello World!
My name is Rohan Singh and I am a sophomore Computer Science and Physics major at Case Western Reserve University at Cleveland, Ohio.
I really enjoy working with low-level programming languages like C/C++ because they are cool :)
I also spend a lot of time working on my personal ML projects and also Quantum Computing.
