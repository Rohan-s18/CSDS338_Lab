# Week 1
## Author: Rohan Singh
Hey There!  
Welcome to your first (real) module for the CSDS 338 Lab. In this module we will be exploring some really cool Linux commands and understanding what they do. For the purposes of this class, understanding how Linux works is really integral to understand how most (if not all) POSIX (or equivalent) Operating Systems work. We'll also look at some commonly used OS Jargon, so that you understand what stuff like GNU, UNIX, POSIX etc. actually mean.  

## Connecting to the EECSLab server
Please follow the given steps to connect to the eecslab server:  
  - Connect your device to **CaseWireless**.  
  - If you are using a Windows machine open Command Prompt or Windows Powershell. If you are using a Mac, open the Terminal.  
  - Paste the following command on your terminal/command prompt (use your case id):  
    > ssh *yourcaseid*@eecslab-1.case.edu  
  - Keep your cwru password handy for this step: You will be provided a prompt where you will have to type out your case password.  
  - You should be all set!  
  - Write the following command:  
    > whoami
