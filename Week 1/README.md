# Week 1 Lab (Due: )
## Author: Rohan Singh

Hey There!  
Welcome to your first Introduction to Operating Systems lab!  

This week, the lab won't have anything crazy or unusual since it is supposed to be an introduction to C. It contains code for simple print commands and arithmetic operations in C. You can find the file descriptions and lab instructions in this file, as well as a section for how to write/compile/run code in C.  

## Files
Here is a description of the files in this week's lab:  
  - **helloworld.c**: This file will be used for print statements in C.         
  - **arithmetic.c**: This file will be used for arithmetic operations in C.    

## Writing and Compiling code in C
Here is a brief description on how to write/compile/run the code for your lab: 
  - **Connecting to the EECSLab server:** Instructions for this are on Canvas and will be demonstrated in class. For this lab you may run the code locally, but in future labs you may want to connect to the EECSLab server.    
  - **Opening VIM:** You should write your code using VIM, this is how you would use it-
    > vim filename.extenstion  
  - **Editing the file:** Once you open the file using vim, to enter the edit mode in VIM, you will have to do the following-  
    > :set paste <enter/return>  
    > i <enter/return>    
  - **Leaving the file:** Once you have edited the file, you can exit vim using-  
    > <esc>  
    > :wq  
  - **Compiling the code:** After writing your code you can compile your C code using the following command-  
    > cc filename.c  
  - **Running the compiled code:** To run the code you just comiled in C, you should-  
    > ./a.out

## Instructions for this weeks lab
Here are the file specific intructions as well as the submission instructions.  

**helloworld.c:**  
  - You must first uncomment the valid print statement(s) from the 4 that are written in the file.  
  - You must write down a print statement for your name.  
  - You should initialize the 'age' variable, and write a print statement that prints out "My age is x", where x is your age.  
  
**arithmetic.c:**
  - You must carry out arithmetic operations on the 2 variables 'x' and 'y' and store the result in a variable called 'result'. 
  - You then  have to print the following after every arithmetic operation: "The result of x <operator> y is result", where you replace x, y and result with the variable values.  
  - The arithmetic operations are the same as those in Java, so this shouldn't really be a problem, but if you face any difficulty you may use this cheatsheet:  
    > addition: +  
    > subtraction: -  
    > multiplication: *  
    > division: /  
    > modulus: %  

**Submission:**  
You must submit a pdf of the screenshots of your code and results on Canvas.
